# Coffe-Helper

A web application written in React and TypeScript will help you create a great drink.
Actually I wanted to make something like an interactive cookbook, only for drinks, nothing prevents you from using it for other recipes. In this application, I implemented what I lacked when cooking, namely a timer for long actions and a calculator for keeping the grams.
